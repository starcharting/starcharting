hello ! we are a 6+ yr prof dxd osdd system
we don't specify who is fronting sorry

minors in system don't list their ages or warn people when speaking with them, please be wary since they are typically more social than other people

they won't interact with you if you have mdni in your link

we don't talk to strangers often, usually are sitting with friends

if our ponies are from the same media feel free to int! but please do not send us random friend requests

you may refer to us collectively with they/them pronouns
we will tell you to use different ones if needed

our hosts are 22 and 26 and we are biologically 21+

we do not make friends with minors (minors in our system are biologically adults so they don't make friends with bodily minors ever)

we are married irl and work full time so we may not be around often

if we add you as a friend you are free to c+h whenever

standard dni applies, we are often offtab so you may whisper

dni proship we aren't going to debate shipping on a silly horse game but no thank you

our hosts are both mlm + bi but otherwise varies

we are white and introjects in system never race claim or use names from sources

please don't interact with us if you are/support endos or compare irls to system things/alters, or got all of your did/osdd information from social media and think you have it to larp as 'fictives' ty

we are not anti self dx but please do genuine research, disorders are serious and not just quirks for fun; osdd and did are debilitating in the real world and not just a fun social thing for rping as anime characters 

dni if you believe in "d/a"s or whatever they're saying these days; kinnies that aren't terminally online are fine
