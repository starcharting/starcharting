prof dxd OSDD 1-b system (diagnosed for 6 yrs)

we don't specify who is fronting usually since our friends can tell so you can ask for current name + pronouns if you want to

if we add you as a friend you are free to c+h whenever we are online! we are usually in the library but wander sometimes

before adding someone we usually introduce ourselves as whoever is fronting

we will tell you our individual pronouns if needed

collectively you can refer to us as stellar + them/them pronouns

our host is 22 and we are biologically 21+ 

we are white + intersex 

legally married irl + working full time so we may not always be active, we are often sitting with our husband + his system, we live together

there are minors in our system that may or may not specify their age prior to engaging with strangers. they will inform you if necessary and will not interact if you have mdni in any of your links

we do not make friends with minors, minors in our system are still biologically adults and do not engage with biological minors either

---

introjects in our system do not race claim nor use source names

typically introjects in our system prefer not to specify they are one, we prefer to be treated like people

---

dni - we won't debate any of this or harass anyone we just prefer not to engage with people who fit these criteria, thank you

proship/neutral • endo/supporter • "no doubles" people • anti-recovery • irls/d/as • people who believe in "blackwashing" • people who are not mlm and mainly consume mlm content • people who are not critical of their interests • minors • terminally online

we don't go out of our way to judge people (unless you're a system being racist/appropriative because we see that a lot on here fsr!) but if you got all of your system info from social media (especially tiktok) and self dx'd it to rp as "fictives" you should not engage with us, we can tell

please don't be explicit/nsfw to us if we don't know you
