we don't specify who is fronting usually since our friends can tell so you can ask for current name + pronouns if you want to

we may randomly interact with strangers or sit with them. this is never malicious! we probably just like your pony

if we add you as a friend you are free to c+h whenever we are online! we are usually in the library but wander sometimes; some of us are clingy and we love our friends!

before adding someone we usually introduce ourselves as whoever is fronting

we will tell you our individual pronouns if needed

collectively you can refer to us as stellar + they/them pronouns

our host is 22 and we are biologically 21+ 

we are white + intersex 

legally married irl + working full time so we may not always be active, we are often sitting with our husband + his system, we live together

not all of us are dating someone/our husband but we don't engage in flirting or rom relationships outside of our domestic partnered system

there are minors in our system that may or may not specify their age prior to engaging with strangers. they will inform you if necessary and will not interact if you have mdni in any of your links

we do not make friends with minors, minors in our system are still biologically adults and do not engage with biological minors either

---

introjects in our system do not race claim nor use source names

typically introjects in our system prefer not to specify they are one, we prefer to not be treated like we're rping

that being said our system is primarily not introjects so please don't assume that whatever horse we're on is wheoever we are; we may kin or relate to a character our skin is but we have our own personalities and prefer to separate from that kind of thing

---

dni - we won't debate any of this or harass anyone we just prefer not to engage with people who fit these criteria; if we interact with you are you fall somewhere on this list (with the except of proship, racism, etc) we do not mean it maliciously. regardless of what we may disagree on we would rather be nice than start ponytown drama

proship/neutral • endo/supporter • "no doubles" people • anti-recovery • irls/d/as • people who believe in "blackwashing" • people who are not mlm and mainly consume mlm content • people who are not critical of their interests • minors • terminally online

we don't go out of our way to judge people (unless you're a "system" being racist/appropriative because we see that a lot on here fsr!) but if you got all of your system info from social media (especially tiktok) and self dx'd it to rp as "fictives" you should not engage with us, we can tell

not really fans of how systems became a trend online so we're wary towards ones we meet on pt, sorry

we don't encourage or believe in "irls" or "d/as". people who kin are fine as long as you're not weird about it

please don't be explicit/nsfw to us if we don't know you

we sometimes (rarely) come on pt while drunk/high, please let us know if that bothers you and we won't int while under the influence! we usually put it in our name when we do
