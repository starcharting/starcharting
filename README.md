• dni

pro/comship • endo/supporters • minors* • irls/d/as • terminally online • think "blackwashing" is real

*casual talk and crowning/booping/etc is ok! but please don't ask for our socials we limit int to pt only

we don't believe in harassing people for no reason (aside from proship/racism/etc) and won't bother you if you're on our dni or anything. if we sit with you or crown you it isn't malicious! we'd rather be nice on the silly pony game

we are wary of most systems on pt, sorry; please dni with us if you're a self dxd system that got all of their info from tiktok or other social media
